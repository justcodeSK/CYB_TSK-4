# Task 4 â€“ Firewall Configuration and Traffic Filtering

## 1. Open Firewall Configuration Tool
For Linux used **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** as the firewall management tool.

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt install ufw -y`

`man ufw`

`vim /etc/default/ufw`

`sudo systemctl start ufw`

`sudo ufw enable`

## Default rule setup
- For fire wall Status to show results we need to first set up basic system firewall rules.
  
  `sudo ufw status`
  
  `sudo ufw default deny incoming`
  
  `sudo ufw default allow outgoing`
  
- If web servers hosted locally or public are not working just we could disabe the ufw completely.
  
  `sudo systemctl status ufw`
  
  `sudo systemctl stop ufw`

## Setting Up some common ports
- PORTS : http-80, https-443, ssh-22, ftp-20/21
  
  `sudo ufw ssh` `sudo ufw https` `sudo ufw http` `sudo allow ftp`

## IMPORTANT: BEFORE RESETTING RULES  
Always remember to *disable* UFW so that you still have access to web servers, SSH, or Telnet services you are using.  
If you mistakenly set a rule that locks you out, this can be solved by disabling UFW.  
Even if you are locked out while using **Linode** *(it has its own command-line interface)*, you can simply reset the firewall using it.

`sudo ufw reset`

## 2.Check UFW status
`sudo ufw status verbose`
## 3.List Current Firewall Rules
`sudo ufw status numbered` or `sudo ufw status` /// simply show the state and rules set in firewall.

## 4.Add a Rule to Block Inbound Traffic on a Specific Port (Telnet - Port 23)
`sudo ufw deny 23`

##4. Test the Rule
`telnet 192.168.56.103` on Guest System-1

## Add a Rule to Block Inbound Traffic on a Specific Port (Telnet - Port 23)
`sudo ufw deny 23`

## 5. Add Rule to Allow SSH (Port 22) on Linux
`sudo ufw allow 22`

## 6. Remove the Test Block Rule to Restore Original State
`sudo ufw status numbered` 

- [ 1] 23/tcp   DENY Anywhere
- [ 2] 22/tcp   ALLOW Anywhere
  
`sudo ufw delete 1`

## How Firewall Filters Traffic
- A firewall works by applying a set of rules to control network traffic.
- Permits traffic matching specific conditions (IP, port, protocol).
-  Blocks traffic that matches the rule.
-  The firewall inspects packets and either forwards or drops them based on defined rules.

## Extra Learned
- We can set rule to a perticular connection
  
  `sudo ufw allow form 192.168.56.103`
  
- Also do the same to a perticular port.
  
  `sudo ufw allow form 192.168.56.103 to any port 22`
  
- We can also set rule to an entire subnet access.
  
  `sudo ufw allow form 192.168.56.0/24`
  
- We can also use the same to deny also.
- Learned to setup telnet local host and also on remote.
- Learned to set up remote access SSH and used toget ipaddrss of guest-1 to guest-2.
